# PythonRecommendations
Algorithm written in Python for recommending new music genres for a new created Student. 

The algorithm looks into the recommendations of other students written from the file 'studenci.txt' and then eliminates the recommendations of students who are not the same age as the new student. 

Then the algorithm eliminates all recommendations who already contain the recommended genre of our new student. 

Finally, the function returns the tuple of most common recommendations of music genres.
